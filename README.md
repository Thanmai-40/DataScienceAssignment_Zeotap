# E-Commerce Customer Analytics: EDA, Lookalike Modeling, and Segmentation

This project aims to analyze customer behavior and develop actionable strategies to improve engagement and retention for an e-commerce platform. The workflow includes three key tasks:

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted a detailed analysis of customer, transaction, and product datasets to uncover trends and patterns.
- Key insights include:
  - Metrics like purchase frequency, average spending, and product popularity.
  - Analysis of customer demographics and purchase behavior to highlight growth opportunities.

## 2. Lookalike Model
- Built a predictive model to identify potential high-value customers by analyzing behavioral and transactional data.
- Leveraged the model to find customers similar to existing high spenders, enabling targeted marketing campaigns.

## 3. Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis and K-Means Clustering
- **RFM Analysis:** Categorized customers based on:
  - **Recency:** How recently they made a purchase.
  - **Frequency:** How often they purchase.
  - **Monetary Value:** How much they spend.
- **K-Means Clustering:**
  - Grouped customers into clusters with distinct purchasing behaviors.
  - Visualized the clusters using a 3D scatter plot for better interpretability.
  - Identified key segments such as loyal customers, high-value buyers, and at-risk customers.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Programming Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning:** Lookalike modeling, K-Means clustering
- **Data Analysis:** RFM Analysis, visualization, data cleaning
